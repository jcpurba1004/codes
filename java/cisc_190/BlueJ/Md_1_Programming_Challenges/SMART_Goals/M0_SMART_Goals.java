          not related to the course, turn off TV, put phone away);

          a problem demonstrated in the book, just to determine if I "get it"
          before moving on;

        * I will know when I need help and make a plan to get help from the 
          professor, a tutor or someone I know in the class;
        * I will ask a question on Pronto or the Q&A Forum when I have felt
          stuck for 15 minutes; if I figure out the solution I will also post
          a summary of my solution;
        * I will answer other students' questions on Pronto or the Q&A Forum;
        * I will contact the professor after class (either in office hours or
          via the Canvas Inbox) if I'm confused about something from class;
        * I will explain my programming projects to my family;
        * I will turn in work by the deadlines;

Problem 6.5: Payroll class

Design a Payroll class that has fields for an employee's name, ID number, hourly pay rate and number of hours worked.
Write the appropriate accessor and mutator methods and a constructor that accepts the employee's name and ID number as arguments.
The class should also have a method that returns the employee's gross pay, which is calculated as the number of hours worked
multiplied by the hourly pay rate. Write a program that demonstrates the class by creating a Payroll object, then asking
the user to enter the data for an employee. The program should display the amount of gross pay earned.

public class Payroll {
	private String name;
	private int idNumber;
	private double hourlyPayRate;
	private double hoursWorked;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
